# ðŸ“± Mobile Programming â€“ Projects & Practice

Welcome to my Mobile Programming repository!  
This repo includes all the projects, sample apps, and practice code Iâ€™m working on as part of the **Mobile Programming1** course.

Here youâ€™ll find various experiments with building mobile apps â€” from basic UI layouts to more dynamic features using modern frameworks and native tools.

### ðŸš€ Topics Explored:
- App UI design principles
- Navigation and activity lifecycles
- Event handling and user interaction
- Working with data (local storage & APIs)
- Animations and transitions
- [More coming soon!]

Feel free to browse through the code, learn along, and maybe even contribute!  
I'm always open to feedback and collaboration ðŸ’¬âœ¨
